YelpCamp is was a simple vanilla JS project I did on one of my courses which I decided to rebuild with reactJS and add additional functionality. 

Users are able to: 
- Sign up
- Create a profile
- Create campsites with descriptions, images, pricing.
- Browse and interact with other users campsites via likes, comments and reviews.

It uses: 
- React
- Redux
- Hooks
- Styled-components
- Firebase (Firestore, storage, hosting)

My favourite parts of this project are the campsite-creator component and the review-creator component. I found building these and getting them functioning and responsive to be a fun challenge and the end results are sleek and easy to use. 

If I were to spend more time on this project (I plan to once I have filled out my portfolio further) I would add friends, messaging and notifcations. I would also handle the average rating calculations on the back end using firebase functions.
