YELP-CAMP_REACT

YelpCamp is was a simple vanilla JS project I did on one of my courses which I decided to rebuild with reactJS and add additional functionality. 

Users are able to: 
- Sign up
- Create a profile
- Create campsites with descriptions, images, pricing.
- Browse and interact with other users campsites via likes, comments and reviews.
- All user made content is editable and deletable. 

It uses: 
- React
- Redux
- Hooks
- Styled-components
- Firebase (Firestore, storage, hosting)

My favourite parts of this are the campsite-creator component and the review-creator component. I found building these and getting them functioning and responsive to be a fun challenge and the end results are sleek and easy to use. 

I found this project to be really enjoyable and will definitely add more functionality in the future. Some functions I plan to add would be additional social features, like friends lists, user to user messaging, a feed with statuses etc.
